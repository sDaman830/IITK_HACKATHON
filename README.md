# Decentralized Identity Management System

## Overview

This project is a decentralized identity management system that leverages Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Web3 technologies to create, store, and verify digital identities on the blockchain. The system uses Ethereum for DID management and IPFS for storing DID documents. It includes an Express-based API for creating and resolving DIDs, and integrates Web3 for Ethereum interactions.

## Features

- **DID Creation**: Generate unique DIDs and associate them with Ethereum addresses.
- **DID Document Storage**: Store and retrieve DID documents using IPFS.
- **DID Verification**: Verify DIDs by resolving them and checking the associated documents.
- **Nonce Signing**: Sign and verify nonces to authenticate users.
- **Decentralized storage**: With the Help of IPFS

## Technologies

- **Ethereum**: For managing DIDs and interacting with smart contracts.
- **IPFS**: For decentralized storage of DID documents.
- **Helia**: For IPFS interactions.
- **Web3.js**: For Ethereum integration.
- **Express**: For creating the API server.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (>=14.x)
- Web3 Provider (e.g., Infura)
- IPFS Daemon or IPFS HTTP API
- Next.js
